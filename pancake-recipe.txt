Ingredients:
 - 1 cup whole wheat flour
 - 1 cup whole milk
 - 2 eggs
 - 1 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar
 - 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
 - Butter as needed for pan
 - 1/4 cup maple syrup

Directions:
 1. Preheat a skillet and spread butter on it with a spatula.
 
 2. In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, milk, and eggs, stirring them with a whisk until they all reach a uniform consistency.
 
 3. Use a large spoon to pour the batter into 4-5 inch medallions on the skillet. Let the medallions cook until golden-brown on one side, then flip and repeat.

 4. Serve the pancakes in a stack topped with butter, maple syrup, and your choice of fruit. Strawberries, raspberries, and pomegranates are excellent choices.
